Of course, there is an aspect of RNG where you can't always win no matter how good you may be, but unlike most other games, it doesn't ruin the fun. There are of course a few bugs when it comes to the servers which is expected upon release. Sometimes the game may not register a jump which can cost you the contest unfortunately. You will visually see your character jump just to be teleported back to where you were and ultimately die. Other than that, I don't see anything wrong with the game! Keep the cosmetic items coming and everyone will be happy."

The item targeting system wont allow you to target certain players at times. And the ranking system seems unfair. When you reach gold if you lose the first game you lose 8 trophies, lose the second game u lose 4 trophies, lose the third you gain 3, win you gain 8. The point system needs to change To -4 on the first round, +0 second round, +4 3rd round +8/+10 For the win. Because as of rn its hard to keep ranking up."

The game is a lot of fun, probably one of the best mobile games to release in a long time, no ads, no pay2win, skill based, it's seriously a blast. However, the addition of the fishing pole has completely ruined the fun, people just pull everyone into the finish line almost immediately and it makes the final prize pot very poor at best and kills the suspense of everyone trying to bat people out."

My goal has been to get to the Front man rank (level 70), and by the time I joined, I had 7 days to do so. I played non stop the last several days to get to level 50 and now I'm stuck. The biggest issue is the amount of times I will be playing and suddenly it disconnects. Once disconnected, you lose your rank points regardless or what happened. I've even crossed the finish line and then it cuts out and I lose."

It said I survive zero games and I want to play with my friend because I,I have fun with her but this. Game takes too much spaceAnd kicks me out of the game but I do love this game but please fix it.

This is a good game for the beginners and gamers too who want to find a good decent game now overall pretty good game with no other problems but that."

If you can't get to level 50 you're not gonna get to level 70 because the developers need to fix the tier system where if you get to a tier you can't go below it so even though the game is fun I think all these issues make it not fun to play if you're trying to get to the highest tier"

If you make it to last game, unless you place top 3, I believe there should be no gain if you lose. 2) add a leaderboard. Once reaching rank 70 we get surplus trophies, but these mean nothing without a leaderboard. 3) more difficulty. The games are Childs play. 4) fix lag. Idk how to do this one but it feels like half of the players in my games are bots because of how bad they are lagging."
